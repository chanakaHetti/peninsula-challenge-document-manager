# PeninsulaChallengeDocumentManager

I completed the task as described:

1. Listed documents.
2. Listed nested documents with expand and collapse functionality.
3. Added name filtering.
4. Added sorting by name and sort order.

I completed this task in exactly one hour. However, I was unable to implement nested sorting by name and sort order within this timeframe. Additionally, there is an issue with the sort order functionality.
