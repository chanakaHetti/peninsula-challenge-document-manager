# PeninsulaChallengeDocumentManager

I completed the task as described:

1. Listed documents.
2. Listed nested documents with expand and collapse functionality.
3. Added name filtering.
4. Added sorting by name and sort order.

I completed this task in exactly one hour. However, I was unable to implement nested sorting by name and sort order within this timeframe. Additionally, there is an issue with the sort order functionality.

Updated - 24/11/2024

I created a new branch named `optimization` and added the following changes:

1. Tidied up the codebase.
2. Added a recursive sorting service
3. Fixed the sort order bug.
